This program simulates a population of individuals 
who have to choose other individuals to link to.

Strategies:

	0- random: Individuals connect with randomly chosen individuals.
	1- PA: (preferential attachment) Individuals pick a sample 
	  and observe links internal to this sample. 
	  They then connect with the most popular individual of the sample.
	2- pick: individuals select an edge, and then connect with one 
	  of the two extremities of that edge.  (to be implemented)

	
The "Network" window shows links between nodes.

The "Degree distribution" window shows the histogram of degrees (degrees larger than 'LinksPerNode' on the x-axis; # of nodes on the y-axis) in logarithmic scales.
